config ZEN_DECISION
	bool "Zen Decision: MSM Userspace Handler"
	depends on SMP && FB
	default n
	help
	  MSM/Qcomm devices have multiple userspace applications that handle
	  CPU hotplugging and frequency operations.

	  ZenDecision is a "handler" to account for behavior caused by
	  disabling some of these services.

	  For example, If MPDecision is disabled and MSM-Thermal_Engine is 
	  enabled in the userspace. Situations where CPUs go offline but never
	  come back online occur. ZenDecision handles the situation of CPUs
	  never coming online when they are supposed.
  
	  ZenDecision ensures all CPUs are online when they are supposed to be by:
	  - Enable all CPUs when screen comes on after wake_wait_delay
	  - Ignore all CPU_UP operations when battery level is <= 15% to respect
	    decisions of MSMThermal.

	  Userspace tunables for ZenDecision (/sys/kernel/zen_decision):
	  - enabled (0 or 1): Enable or disable the driver.
	  - wake_wait_time (0-60000): How long to wait before executing CPU_UP work.
	  - bat_threshold_ignore (0-100, 0=disabled): Don't do any CPU_UP work up to
	     this battery charge level.

	  WARNING: ZenDecision is not a direct replacement for any of the MSM userspace
	  services. It is simply designed to "handle" specific behaviors that are caused
	  by disabling these services.

	  If unsure, say N.
